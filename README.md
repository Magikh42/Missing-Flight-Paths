# MissingFlightPaths

## Description
When you talk to a flight master, and open the flight/taxi map, green exclamation marks will be pinned on the map where that character does not have a flight path unlocked. Missing underwater nodes of Vashj'ir will only be shown if you talk to one of the seahorses that operate as the flight masters for that zone. Some flight nodes have been destroyed over the years, thanks to the Cataclysm and N'zoth's invasion. These nodes are not considered in this addon, only "present day" nodes that don't require phasing by a bronze dragon.

## Planned Updates
* Add pins to the world map after opening the taxi/flight map for the first time
