# MissingFlightPaths

## Description
When you talk to a flight master, and open the flight/taxi map, green exclamation marks will be pinned both on the taxi map and world map where that character does not have a flight path unlocked. Missing underwater nodes of Vashj'ir will only be shown if you talk to one of the seahorses that operate as the flight masters for that zone. Some flight nodes have been destroyed over the years, thanks to the Cataclysm and N'zoth's invasion. These nodes are ignored in this addon. Only "present day" nodes that don't require phasing by a bronze dragon will be shown if they are missing.
